Programming Background:

I have a very limited backround in programming. I had no idea I would enjoy it as much as I do. My favorite project in CS165 (accelerated intro to computer programming) was creating a fighting game where the user selected number of fighters (up to 10) and which team they were on (good or evil). Each fighter had skills (like hobbit ability to dodge attacks or demon ability to do demonic damage) and at random times the fighter would invoke their skills which might result in a high attack damage output but a block from another special skill. The game was word based but it would display the turn (demon attacks with demonic attack - dwarf blocks attack). It was fun setting up the coding necessary to get it to work.

Hobbies:

I enjoy programming and other things in life.
